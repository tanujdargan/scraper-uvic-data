While we will explore some critiques of these dominant tendencies, the focus will be on other ways of working together to transform the conditions under which we live, including direct action, mutual aid, counter-institutions, desertion, subsistence, and autonomy."

ANTH250 recommended, but not required. This undergraduate course, suitable for both majors and non-majors, will outline Neandertal biology, behavior, and current debates over the place of the Neandertals in human evolution. The main goal of the course is an up to date understanding about who the Neandertals were, and how they lived, through the examination of paleontological, archaeological, and molecular data. What did they look like? What did they eat? What sort of tools did they make? Were they our ancestors or not? What’s this I hear about a cave bear cult? As we evaluate the available evidence (and its limitations), we will also investigate the history of scientific and popular thought about Neandertals, and how it has reflected changes in broader societal attitudes over time. The course will include in-class, hands-on laboratory activities and open discussions. The reading list will range from selected journal articles to excerpts from popular literature like Clan of the Cave Bear."

This course will be a survey of case studies from a wide-ranging selection of regions and time periods, organized thematically around different so-called wicked behaviours. Rather than focus on the heroes of the past, this course will highlight the material remains of people behaving badly and engaging in deviant activities. Topics will include psychedelic drug use, cannibalism, prostitution, and the smuggling of illicit contraband, among others. Along the way, we will question whether these individuals are truly the villains of the past or if it is our own misconceptions that make them appear so."

The story of our evolution and prevailing theories explaining how and why it proceeded are famously contentious. This three-field-oriented course (encompassing archaeological, cultural, and biological anthropological perspectives) is organized as a series of “capsules” investigating specific contemporary and historical controversies in human evolution, and using these capsules to introduce and elaborate upon basic anthropological principles.
