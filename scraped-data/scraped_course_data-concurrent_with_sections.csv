ANTH250 recommended, but not required. This undergraduate course, suitable for both majors and non-majors, will outline Neandertal biology, behavior, and current debates over the place of the Neandertals in human evolution. The main goal of the course is an up to date understanding about who the Neandertals were, and how they lived, through the examination of paleontological, archaeological, and molecular data. What did they look like? What did they eat? What sort of tools did they make? Were they our ancestors or not? What’s this I hear about a cave bear cult? As we evaluate the available evidence (and its limitations), we will also investigate the history of scientific and popular thought about Neandertals, and how it has reflected changes in broader societal attitudes over time. The course will include in-class, hands-on laboratory activities and open discussions. The reading list will range from selected journal articles to excerpts from popular literature like Clan of the Cave Bear."

We will explore the interests of the different parties, the values and relationships and look at how ecology, economics, First Nations government-to-government decision making and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) influence how agreements are developed. With a focus on British Columbia and the role of multi stakeholder agreements including the Great Bear Rainforest, we will examine how First Nations are playing a leading role in re-imagining land stewardship. We will look at some of the key elements that make a successful agreement: First Nations decision making, old growth protection, carbon offsets, conservation financing, environmental monitoring, eco-tourism, and green energy. We will go beyond media soundbites to better appreciate the complex relationships, values and interests driving change."

This course explores a range of responses to the catastrophe in which we live today: not just a catastrophe of climate instability and COVID-19; but also of isolation, extraction, depression, exploitation, hierarchy, debt, violence, boredom, and anxiety. This class foregrounds perspectives that seek to turn away from—or move beyond—dominant approaches to social and political change, including protest, institutional reform, and individual ethics. While we will explore some critiques of these dominant tendencies, the focus will be on other ways of working together to transform the conditions under which we live, including direct action, mutual aid, counter-institutions, desertion, subsistence, and autonomy."
